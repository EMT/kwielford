# Kwielford V1 Plan

Status date: 2026-02-18

## Current Product Focus

1. Improvement Chat
- Team can chat with Kwielford about how to improve Kwielford.
- Kwielford responds with concrete build/setup plans (roadmap, memory, integrations, workflows, quality).

2. Incremental Access Expansion
- Team can plan how to provide progressively broader access across channels and systems.
- Access expansion is phased, measurable, and gated by quality checks.

## Phase Outline

1. Assistant conversation quality
- Keep responses structured and implementation-oriented.
- Add templates for roadmap, access rollout, and integration sequencing.

2. Access control framework
- Define access tiers (pilot channels, expanded channels, system integrations).
- Require explicit owners and approval gates for each tier.

3. Validation loop
- Track outcomes: usefulness, missed actions, and false positives.
- Update prompts and workflows weekly based on feedback.

## Out of Scope (for now)

- Thread summarisation and related slash-command/workflow execution paths.
